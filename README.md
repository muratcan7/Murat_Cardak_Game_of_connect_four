# Connect Four Game
## Overview
This Connect Four game is a simple, interactive game implemented in Python using the Tkinter GUI library. The game allows two players (Red and Yellow) to take turns dropping tokens into a 7-column, 6-row vertically suspended grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.

## Technology Choices

## Python
* Python 3.12: Chosen for its simplicity and widespread support in scientific and academic communities. Python's extensive standard library and easily readable syntax make it ideal for a wide range of applications, including simple games.

* Tkinter: Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It is lightweight and integrated with Python, making it an accessible choice for building simple GUI applications without needing to install third-party libraries.

## Tkinter
GUI Framework: Built into Python, making it easy to use and deploy on most systems without additional installations. It provides a robust set of tools to create windowed applications and handles GUI interactions seamlessly.

# Installation

## Prerequisites
* Ensure Python 3.12 is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org or install it via a package manager like Homebrew.

* Tkinter should be included with Python installations by default for Windows and macOS from python.org. If using Homebrew or another package manager, you might need to ensure Tkinter is specifically installed.

## Steps
* Clone the repository or download the ZIP file and extract it.

* Navigate to the project directory where connect_four.py is located.


## Running the Application
To run the game, execute the following command in the terminal:

* python3 connect_four_gui.py
